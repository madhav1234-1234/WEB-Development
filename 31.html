        // So here, we have noticed that the value of the variable gets easily changed and it can create a problem if we do not remember the initial value given the variable. It is because the scope of var is global here. But if we declare the var inside any function, then its scope will remain under that function.

        // However, it is highly recommended to use let instead of var to avoid confusion of the scope of the variable.
        let a="u";
        {
            let a="u6";
            console.log(a)

        // const a="This cannot be changed";
        // a="I want to change this.this cannot be changed";
        // console.log(a)  
        // In the above example, we have declared a as a constant, therefore, its value cannot be changed further by any means. Hence, it shows an error.

    //   It is because the case has matched exactly with the value of cups. However, if we remove the break statement then all the values will be printed. And in case, no value matches with any case, then the default statement will be printed.
