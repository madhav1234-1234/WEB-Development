        // The object class represents one of JavaScriptâ€™s data types. It is used to store various keyed collections and more complex entities. Objects can be created using the Object() constructor.

        // we have two types of values used in JavaScript- primitive and reference. To be more simple, either we create objects or primitive data types

        // The primitive data types are as follows-
        let myVar=34;
        let myVar2="string";
        let myVar3=true;
        let myVar4=null;
        let myVar5=undefined;
        // Apart from primitive data types, all the other are objects.

        let employee={
            name:"maddy",
            salary:5,
            channel:"gun shop owner",
            channel2:"missile shop",
        }
        console.log(employee);
        console.log(employee.channel2);
        console.log(employee['channel2']);


        // n this example, an employee is an object that contains the name, salary, channel, and channel 2 inside it. This is an example, where we create  objects manually by us. 


        // ARRAYS
        // There is a special kind of object known as Arrays. The JavaScript Array class is a global object that is used in the construction of arrays; which are high level, list-like objects. An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time. 

        let names=[1,2,4,"Maddy",undefined];
        console.log(names);
        console.log(names[1]);
        // An array can contain any type of value in it whether it is a string, integer, or boolean.

        // An array can contain any type of value in it 
        // whether it is a string, integer, or boolean.

        // We can also create arrays with the help of a new keyword 
        let names1 =new Array(11,25,4,"Maddy",undefined);
        names1.push("This is pushed");
        console.log(names1);


        // To know the length of an array, we can use the length function
        console.log(names1.length);

        // to sort this array, we can use sort() function
        names1 = names1.sort();
        console.log(names1);

        let names=new Array(23);
        // It allocate 23 empty spaces.
