        This is arrow function learning.

        // An arrow function expression is a syntactically compact alternative to a regular function expression, although without its own bindings to this, arguments, super or new.target keywords. Arrow function expressions are ill-suited as methods, and they cannot be used as constructors.
        function greet() {
            console.log("Good morning");
        }
        greet();

        // But if we write the same function with the help of arrow functions then our work will reduce 
        // Arrow function
        let greet1 = () => {
            console.log('Good morning');
        }

        // This function can also be used with the setTimeout() function
        setTimeout(() => {
            console.log("We are inside settimeout");
        }, 3000);

        // We can also simply add the two numbers with the arrow functions 
        let sum2 = (a, b) => a + b;
        console.log(sum2);

        // If we have any single variable in our code, then we donâ€™t need to put any braces also.
        let half = a => a / 2;
        console.log(half);

        // Now let us see the use of lexical this with the help of an example. If we make the object obj1 and an array of names and then make a function as speak
        let obj1 = {
            names: ["Maddy", "Maddy1", "Maddy2", "Maddy3"],
            speak() {
                this.names.forEach((student) => {
                    console.log("Kukdoo Koo " + student);
                });
            }
        }
        obj1.speak();

        //  we have made a speak function, add a forEach() loop to it, and then added an arrow function. But if we add a variable greeting and add this.greeting inside the console.log
        let obj2 = {
            greeting: "Good Morning",
            names: ["Maddy", "Maddy1", "Maddy2", "Maddy3"],
            speak() {
                this.names.forEach((student) => {
                    console.log(this.greeting + " Kukdoo Koo " + student);
                });
            }
        }
        obj2.speak();
        // This variable is normally used to point the variable inside the function. But in the case of arrow functions, it points the variable outside the function. This is known as lexical this.
